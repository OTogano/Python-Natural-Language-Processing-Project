# Python Natural Language Processing Project
This Natural Language Processing project consists of two smaller projects. Both utilize pythons data science libraries as well as SKlearn NLP tools and models.
This project was meant to apply the concepts learnt about Natural Language Processing with python.

# 1. Spam Detector
In this project, a model was trained to identify spam mail and normal (ham) mail. The model was trained on the UCI dataset containing a collection of spam and ham mails.
This project ustilised the nltk library, sklearn tools such as Count Vectorizer,tdif_transfromer and Multinomial DB.
Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas were used for Data analysis and Visualization.

# 2. Review Classification
In this project, a simple model was trained to classify yelp reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text conent in the review.
Sklearn tool were used as well as pipeline methods for more complex tasks.
Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas were used for Data analysis and Visualization.
